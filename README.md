# pfs

This project is a portfolio project I am working on to showcase my skills on my site. I hope that I can turn it into something great for others to use so that they too may save time laying out their own skills.

Firstly I am going to build it more or less on the fly and hopefully develop some structure as I go.

# Technologies Used
Initially I am going to keep my tool set small and each item is listed as follows:
  HTML5
  CSS3
  JavaScript
  PHP/CodeIgniter
  MySQL
Later on down the track I will explore using a MEAN stack and developing an App for PhoneGap or something like that.
