# pfs - Portfolio Showcase 2016

This project is a portfolio project I am working on to showcase my skills on my site. I hope that I can turn it into something great for others to use so that they too may save time laying out their own skills.

Firstly I am going to build it more or less on the fly and hopefully develop some structure as I go.

# Technologies Used
Initially I am going to keep my tool set small and each item is listed as follows:
  HTML5
  CSS3
  JavaScript
  PHP/CodeIgniter
  MySQL
Later on down the track I will explore using a MEAN stack and developing an App for PhoneGap or something like that.

You will notice a template file written in HTML5 - I will start each page with this and modify from there.

# Stage 1 - A favour to myself!
Stage 1 - Personal: The idea for what I am doing; but may not be useful to anyone in the future; is to first make a page just from HTML5 and then make a copy with CSS3 and finally add JavaScript to it for fun. I want to tie this into CodeIgniter for different pages and it will specify on each page what tech was used to build the currently viewed page. Of course I want examples that illustrate my skills in each of the above mentioned technologies including MySQL.

# Stage 2 - The Actual App
Stage 2 - Start building the App I want to share with the world so that others may use it to build their own portfolio - the idea behind this stage is an App that makes it easy to display assets of your portfolio such as graphics, links, articles and as much other stuff as others or myself can think of.
